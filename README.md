## Featured Repositories

### [Meraki Monitoring with Grafana](https://github.com/charliemiller140/Meraki-Grafana-Public)  
A full-stack, self-hosted monitoring system for Cisco Meraki networks collects metrics using the Meraki API, stores them in InfluxDB, and visualizes trends in Grafana. Includes modular Python scripts, GitHub Actions CI/CD, and Ansible-based deployment on Ubuntu VMs. 

### [Proxmox CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/charliemiller140/proxmox-ci-pipeline-public)  
A full CI/CD pipeline for provisioning Ubuntu VMs in Proxmox using Terraform, Cloud-Init, Ansible, and GitHub Actions. Supports VLAN tagging, static IPs, self-hosted runners, and post-deployment automation. Bridges infrastructure-as-code with real-world homelab and production workflows.

### [O365 Endpoints to Velocloud](https://github.com/charliemiller140/O365toVelocloud-Public)  
Automates SD-WAN policy generation by ingesting Microsoft 365 endpoint telemetry via REST API. Reduces manual configuration and accelerates policy rollout across distributed networks via Velocloud Orchestrator.

### [Ansible-Homelab](https://github.com/charliemiller140/Ansible-Homelab-Public)  
A collection of Ansible playbooks for automating VM provisioning, Docker deployments, and system configuration in a Proxmox-based homelab. Includes SSH key injection, templated roles, and container management with Watchtower and Trilium Notes.  
**Note:** Superseded by the Proxmox CI/CD Pipeline above.

### [ClamAV Ansible CI](https://github.com/charliemiller140/Clamav-Ansible-Ci-Public)  
A lightweight CI pipeline for automated ClamAV deployment and scanning using Ansible and GitHub Actions. Supports scheduled definition updates and recursive scanning on Linux systems. Designed to embed basic antivirus hygiene into infrastructure-as-code workflows.

### [No-IP Dynamic DNS Updater](https://github.com/charliemiller140/NoIpUpdater-Public)  
A Dockerized Bash script that automatically updates No-IP Dynamic DNS records when your public IP changes. Designed to run continuously in the background with no external dependencies beyond Docker and Crontab.

### [Bin Collection Alexa Skill](https://github.com/charliemiller140/BinCollection-Public)  
An Alexa skill for real-time local bin collection reminders (rubbish, recycling, garden waste). Uses Selenium on a Raspberry Pi to scrape council bin schedules and AWS Lambda to deliver voice reminders via the Alexa SDK.

### [Desktop Network Info GUI](https://github.com/charliemiller140/Desktop-Network-Info-GUI-Public)  
A Python GUI application that displays real-time IP, DNS, and interface details. Includes a built-in toggle for DHCP vs static IP, with a 5-second auto-refresh cycle.
